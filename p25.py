# Project Euler problem 25 

# Since Fn is asymptotic to (phi^n)/(sqrt(5), the number of digits in  Fn is 
# asymptotic to nlog10(phi)~=0,2090n. 
# As a consequence, for every integer d > 1 there are either 4 or 5 Fibonacci 
# numbers with d decimal digits.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    rez = 1000/0.2090;
    
    print rez

# So the solution is around 'rez' ..in this case [rez]-2
